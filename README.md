# Week 1 - Computational Thinking

Students begin to learn their way around Visual Studio and learn some of the fundamentals of the language.

Objectives:
* Begin to understand working with Visual Studio.
* Using `Console.WriteLine()` to output

Key Terminology:
* Input: what goes IN to the computer (whether it be commands entered on a keyboard or data from another computer
* Output: what is produced, or the product, can be a web page, an app, our text sent to the Console
* Solution: A group of one or more Projects that work together.
* Project: A group of related code that work together.
* Class: created in Eclipse to house code that becomes the blueprint for an object read more
* Object: an instance of a class
* Object Oriented Programming (OOP): a shift from just writing logic towards writing about the objects we want to manipulate
* camelCase: naming convention used in C# to combine multiple words together. Ex: playerScore
* PascalCase: naming convention used in C# to combine multiple words together. Ex: PlayerScore
* Concatenation: using + to join strings
* Syntax: A set of rules that define how code needs to be written
* Condition: evaluates to true or false (found in decision structures)

using System;

namespace ConsoleApp1
{
    class Program
    {

        {
            Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
            Console.WriteLine("I can code it!");

            Console.WriteLine(42);
            Console.WriteLine(1.23);
            Console.WriteLine(2 + 3);
        }
    }
}

## Introduction to GIT

Git is one of the most popular Version Control Systems out there.  We'll use Git, along with Github to keep track of our code and the changes that we make to it.

# Week 2 Flow of Control and Class Design

Learn how to control the flow of execution in your application. Begin developing capabilities to store larger amounts of data and be able to iterate through that data. Begin the process of Object Oriented Programming. Test-Drive an application's design from start to finish.

Objectives:
* Understanding when to use loops
* Understand why loops are needed
* Write code blocks that use `while` and `do/while` loops
* Write code blocks that use `for` loops
* Write code blocks that use `foreach` loops
* Begin to understand infinite loops
* Basic usage of the debugger
* Be able to work with Branching statements like `break`, `continue`, and `return`

Key Terminology:
* Conditional Statement: Evaluates to either true or falseâ€¦allows for executing decision structures or loops
* Iteration: A pass through a loop (lap)
* Code Block: Code contained within { }. Code Blocks are useful in loops `while(condition){ do this and this and this }`
* Initialization: Assigning a variable a beginning value
* Array: A data structure that contains a group of elements all sharing the same data type
* Index(plural Indices): Location of an item in an Array (begins at 0)
* Traversal: A loop that visits every element in the Array
* Class: Used to house code that becomes the blueprint for an object
* Object: an instance of a class
* Object Oriented Programming (OOP): a shift from just writing logic towards writing about the objects we want to manipulate
* Constructor: shares the same name as the class, has no data type, constructs the object

## Flow of Control

This [Google Doodle](https://www.google.com/doodles/celebrating-50-years-of-kids-coding) from December 4, 2017, celebrates 50 years of kids coding. It offers a great visualization of how loops work. Can you use loops to find the shortest solution to each challenge?

## While Loops

TODO: Remove dependencies on prior code.

Instructor notes: Use debugger to allow students to visualize.

## Designing Classes

Classes are one of the fundamental building blocks that are used to create software.

Objectives:
* Students should be able to use TDD to drive the creation of a class.
* Students should be able to create instance of a class (objects) using the `new` operator.
* Students should be able to create and manipulate instance variables.
* Students should be able to create and use methods.
