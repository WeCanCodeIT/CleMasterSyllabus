# Week 1 - Computational Thinking

Students begin to learn their way around Visual Studio and learn some of the fundamentals of the language.

Key Terminology:
* Input: what goes IN to the computer (whether it be commands entered on a keyboard or data from another computer
* Output: what is produced, or the product, can be a web page, an app, our text sent to the Console
* Solution: A group of one or more Projects that work together.
* Project: A group of related code that work together.
* Class: created in Eclipse to house code that becomes the blueprint for an object read more
* Object: an instance of a class
* Object Oriented Programming (OOP): a shift from just writing logic towards writing about the objects we want to manipulate
* camelCase: naming convention used in C# to combine multiple words together. Ex: playerScore
* PascalCase: naming convention used in C# to combine multiple words together. Ex: PlayerScore
* Concatenation: using + to join strings
* Syntax: A set of rules that define how code needs to be written
* Condition: evaluates to true or false (found in decision structures)

## Introduction

Setting expectations for everyone about course content and high level flow.

[Slides Source Code](https://github.com/WeCanCodeIT/CleMasterSyllabus/blob/master/SlideDeck/src/introduction/intro/index.md)


## School Policies

More expectation setting.  Grading, attendance, pass/fail, homework, late & incomplete assignments, academic probation, who to talk to.

## Student Welcome Trello Boards

TODO: I've seen this, but I'm not sure when/where this takes place.  Here seems like a good spot?


## Hello World

Follow along with the slides to create your first C# Application!

## Syntax - Statements & Blocks of Code

Walk through the following example code, highlighting:
* Statements
* Expressions
* Blocks of Code
* Naming Conventions
* etc.


```code csharp
using System;

namespace ConsoleApp1
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
            Console.WriteLine("I can code it!");

            Console.WriteLine(42);
            Console.WriteLine(1.23);
            Console.WriteLine(2 + 3);
        }
    }
}
```

# Week 2

TODO: Summary

Key Terminology:
* Conditional Statement: Evaluates to either true or falseâ€¦allows for executing decision structures or loops
* Iteration: A pass through a loop (lap)
* Code Block: Code contained within { }. Code Blocks are useful in loops `while(condition){ do this and this and this }`
* Initialization: Assigning a variable a beginning value
* Array: A data structure that contains a group of elements all sharing the same data type
* Index(pl Indicies): Location of an item in an Array (begins at 0)
* Traversal: A loop that visits every element in the Array
* Class: created in Eclipse to house code that becomes the blueprint for an object read more
* Object: an instance of a class
* Object Oriented Programming (OOP): a shift from just writing logic towards writing about the objects we want to manipulate
* Constructor: shares the same name as the class, has no data type, constructs the object
